# Project Name: Fictional Restaurant Menu

In this project, I created a basic webpage for a fictional restaurant (which I named BEFULL). I used HTML to structure the content and include some 
elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.

## specifications

- Title inserted (Befull Restaurant Menu) using the <h1> tag.
- Headings for each menu section (appetizers, main courses, desserts) were added.
- At least 4 items with their names and brief descriptions were added under each heading.
- I used an unordered list for each section of the menu.
- I inserted a form to make it possible for customers or clients to send us messages.
- The last image <img> contains a hyperlink that makes it possible for anyone who clicks on the image to make reservations. 
- I added a link at the bottom of the page leading to a contact page using the <footer> tag.
