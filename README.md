# Fictional Restaurant Menu

In this project, I created a basic webpage for a fictional restaurant (which I named BEFULL). I used HTML to structure the content and include some 
elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.

## specifications

- Title inserted (<h1>Befull Restaurant Menu</h1>)
- Headings for each section of the menu (appetizers, main courses, desserts) were added.
- At least 4 items with their names and brief description was added under each heading.
- I used an unordered list for each section of the menu.
- I added a link at the bottom of the page leading to a contact page using the <footer> tag.
